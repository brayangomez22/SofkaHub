								ones that do not ask. And don't worry, nobody is going to judge you, on the
								contrary, they will help you get ahead.

								On different occasions, it happens to programmers who do not find a solution to
								a very specific problem, since not everything is found in Google. That is why
								SofkaHub offers you a more personalized space to solve problems with more
								experienced developers or those who have already gone through the same thing.
