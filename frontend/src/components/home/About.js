				Something that has always characterized the Sofkians is that they do whatever it takes
				to keep their word and their responsibilities. This does not always go quite right,
				because there are several tasks that go over the budgeted time and, strangely, they end
				up staying until 3 in the morning to complete them ...
				<br />
				<br />
				For this we have created SofkaHub, a social network for Sofkian developers who find
				themselves in trouble late at night. Seeking thus that all Sofkianos meet their
				objectives regardless of the time they are working.
				<br />
				<br />
				From this screen you can log in with your Google account and publish any doubts that
				arise in the name of your profile and any colleague who is awake will be able to give
				you an answer. No more nights of frustration!
